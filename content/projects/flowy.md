Flowy is a Telegram mini app that brings payments and commerce directly into the messaging experience. No need to switch apps or remember passwords.

## Features

- **Instant Payments** — Send and receive money using just a username
- **In-App Store** — Browse and purchase goods without leaving Telegram
- **Transaction History** — Track all your payments in one place
- **Secure Wallet** — End-to-end encrypted transactions

## Tech Stack

Built with TypeScript and Node.js, using the Telegram Bot API for seamless integration. PostgreSQL handles the transactional data with proper ACID compliance.

## Why Telegram?

Most people in my target market already use Telegram daily. Instead of building yet another payment app, I brought payments to where people already are.
