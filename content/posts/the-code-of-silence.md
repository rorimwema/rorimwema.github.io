In the quiet hum of the server room,
Where logic weaves its digital loom,
We trade in absolute, binary truth,
Seeking elegance in eternal youth.

But life is fuzzy, a float precision,
Full of race conditions and blurred vision.
We debug the world line by line,
Hoping the output will be divine.

*Is the universe just a recursive call?*
*Or are we trapped in an endless `while(true)` loop after all?*
