My personal Neovim configuration. I've spent way too many hours tweaking this to be the perfect dev environment.

### Features
*   **Blazing Fast**: Startup time < 50ms.
*   **LSP Support**: Native LSP integration for TypeScript, Go, Rust, OCaml, and more.
*   **Plugin Manager**: Uses `lazy.nvim` for efficient plugin loading.
*   **Aesthetics**: Custom colorscheme integration (Flexoki support included).

Check out the [repository](https://github.com/rorimwema/nvim-config) for installation instructions.
