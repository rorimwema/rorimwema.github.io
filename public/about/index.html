<h3 id="my-toolbox-affectionately-overcomplicated">My Toolbox (Affectionately Overcomplicated)</h3>
<p><strong>OCaml</strong> — My comfort zone. Currently building a Lisp interpreter because apparently writing one language in another language isn&rsquo;t meta enough.</p>
<p><strong>Erlang</strong> — For when I need processes that don&rsquo;t crash when I inevitably make mistakes. The &ldquo;let it fail&rdquo; philosophy speaks to me on a spiritual level.</p>
<p><strong>Elm</strong> — JavaScript that is not shit. Type-safe frontend development; what a concept.</p>
<p><strong>Haskell</strong> — I &ldquo;cheat&rdquo; with it. Building a search engine and pretending I understand monads. (I don&rsquo;t. Nobody does. We all just pretend.)</p>
<p><strong>The Art of Computer Programming</strong> — Currently working through Knuth. Volume 4B is my gym membership—I keep paying for it but rarely show up.</p>
<h3 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h3>
<p>I admire <strong>Mat Armstrong&rsquo;s</strong> approach: solve the actual problem, ignore the hype, write code that makes sense six months later. Complexity is a bug, not a feature. If you need a diagram to explain your architecture, your architecture is wrong.</p>
<h3 id="currently-building">Currently Building</h3>
<ul>
<li>A Lisp interpreter in OCaml (because every programmer must go through this rite of passage)</li>
<li>A search engine in Haskell (because crawling the web seemed easier than understanding Zettabyte-scale systems papers)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-goal">The Goal</h3>
<p>Uncomplicate things. Make programming accessible. Prove that elegant solutions exist—you just have to stop accepting messy ones.</p>
