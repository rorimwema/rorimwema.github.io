# Wassup! 👋

I'm **Clinton Rori**.

I'm a programmer who loves hacking things together and figuring out how they tick.

Welcome to my digital garden. Here you'll find:
*   **Brain dumps** on code, unexpected bugs, and "aha!" moments.
*   **Projects** I'm tinkering with (some might even be finished!).
*   **Musings** on tech, life, and everything in between.

Take a look around, maybe you'll find something that sparks an idea. Or partially breaks your production env. (Jk... mostly).
