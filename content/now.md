## What I'm Doing Now

*Last updated: January 2026*

### Building

**[Flowy](/projects/flowy/)** — A Telegram mini app for money and commerce. Making payments simple inside the app you already use.

**[Lisp Interpreter](/projects/nvim-config/)** — In OCaml, because every programmer needs to write a Lisp at least once.

### Learning

- Reading through *The Art of Computer Programming* (Knuth) — Volume 4B at the moment
- Diving deeper into distributed systems and consensus algorithms
- Trying to finally understand monads in Haskell (still pretending)

### Using

- **Editor**: Neovim with my own [config](/projects/nvim-config/)
- **Language**: OCaml for serious work, Python for quick scripts
- **OS**: macOS with a heavily customized terminal setup

### Reading

- *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs* (SICP) — re-reading, still learning new things
- Various papers on type theory and compiler design
