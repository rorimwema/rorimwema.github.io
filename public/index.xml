      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the quiet hum of the server room,&#xA;Where logic weaves its digital loom,&#xA;We trade in absolute, binary truth,&#xA;Seeking elegance in eternal youth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But life is fuzzy, a float precision,&#xA;Full of race conditions and blurred vision.&#xA;We debug the world line by line,&#xA;Hoping the output will be divine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is the universe just a recursive call?&lt;/em&gt;&#xA;&lt;em&gt;Or are we trapped in an endless &lt;code&gt;while(true)&lt;/code&gt; loop after all?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the quiet hum of the server room,
Where logic weaves its digital loom,
We trade in absolute, binary truth,
Seeking elegance in eternal youth.</p>
<p>But life is fuzzy, a float precision,
Full of race conditions and blurred vision.
We debug the world line by line,
Hoping the output will be divine.</p>
<p><em>Is the universe just a recursive call?</em>
<em>Or are we trapped in an endless <code>while(true)</code> loop after all?</em></p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I believe computers are simple. It&amp;rsquo;s us humans who keep making them complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m that programmer who reads programming language theory for fun and genuinely enjoys compiler design. While others debate framework-of-the-week, I&amp;rsquo;m deep in the ML family, OCaml is my daily driver, and yes, I use the type system to prevent bugs &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; they happen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-toolbox-affectionately-overcomplicated&#34;&gt;My Toolbox (Affectionately Overcomplicated)&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OCaml&lt;/strong&gt; — My comfort zone.

<p>I&rsquo;m that programmer who reads programming language theory for fun and genuinely enjoys compiler design. While others debate framework-of-the-week, I&rsquo;m deep in the ML family, OCaml is my daily driver, and yes, I use the type system to prevent bugs <em>before</em> they happen.</p>
<h3 id="my-toolbox-affectionately-overcomplicated">My Toolbox (Affectionately Overcomplicated)</h3>
<p><strong>OCaml</strong> — My comfort zone. Currently building a Lisp interpreter because apparently writing one language in another language isn&rsquo;t meta enough.</p>
<p><strong>Erlang</strong> — For when I need processes that don&rsquo;t crash when I inevitably make mistakes. The &ldquo;let it fail&rdquo; philosophy speaks to me on a spiritual level.</p>
<p><strong>Elm</strong> — JavaScript that is not shit. Type-safe frontend development; what a concept.</p>
<p><strong>Haskell</strong> — I &ldquo;cheat&rdquo; with it. Building a search engine and pretending I understand monads. (I don&rsquo;t. Nobody does. We all just pretend.)</p>
<p><strong>The Art of Computer Programming</strong> — Currently working through Knuth. Volume 4B is my gym membership—I keep paying for it but rarely show up.</p>
<h3 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h3>
<p>I admire <strong>Mat Armstrong&rsquo;s</strong> approach: solve the actual problem, ignore the hype, write code that makes sense six months later. Complexity is a bug, not a feature. If you need a diagram to explain your architecture, your architecture is wrong.</p>
<h3 id="currently-building">Currently Building</h3>
<ul>
<li>A Lisp interpreter in OCaml (because every programmer must go through this rite of passage)</li>
<li>A search engine in Haskell (because crawling the web seemed easier than understanding Zettabyte-scale systems papers)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-goal">The Goal</h3>
<p>Uncomplicate things. Make programming accessible. Prove that elegant solutions exist—you just have to stop accepting messy ones.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>&ldquo;The best code is the code you don&rsquo;t have to write. The second best is the code you write once and never touch again.&rdquo;</em></p>

      <title>So You Want to Be a Programmer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So you want to be a programmer. You think it is about computers, about code, about some neat abstractions stacked in your head. But really, it is about patience and curiosity and the relentless itch of wanting to see what happens when you poke at the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Programming is not glamorous. It is not about showing off frameworks or boasting about your GitHub streak. It is about sitting there, staring at a problem, feeling your brain ache a little, and then — suddenly — a door opens, a tiny mechanism clicks, and the machine obeys. That moment is bliss, more than any job title or paycheck.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Programming is not glamorous. It is not about showing off frameworks or boasting about your GitHub streak. It is about sitting there, staring at a problem, feeling your brain ache a little, and then — suddenly — a door opens, a tiny mechanism clicks, and the machine obeys. That moment is bliss, more than any job title or paycheck.</p>
<p>Charles Bukowski said writing is a gut feeling, a way to bleed yourself onto the page. Programming is the same, only your bleeding is logic, your words are functions, your paragraphs are data structures. Sussman would tell you it is about understanding the system, the abstraction, not just hacking on the surface. Paul Graham would tell you to build something people want, to start with what fascinates you, and then sweat the details until your code becomes invisible, elegant, and powerful.</p>
<p>If you want to be a programmer, be prepared to fail. Be prepared to love the failures, because every bug is a teacher, every crash is a conversation. Be authentic. Write code like you breathe — messy, desperate, alive.</p>
<p>Programming is not a career. It is a calling. And if you want it, you will not be stopped by languages, frameworks, or abstractions. You will be stopped only by yourself.</p>
